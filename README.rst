PQDM is a TQDM and concurrent futures wrapper to allow enjoyable paralellization of
iterating through an Iterable with a progress bar.

Install & Use
-------------

To install ::

    pip install pqdm


and use ::

    from pqdm.processes import pqdm
    # If you want threads instead:
    # from pqdm.threads import pqdm

    args = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    # args = range(1,6) would also work

    def square(a):
        return a*a

    result = pqdm(args, square, n_jobs=2)

For more examples variants check the `Usage <https://pqdm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ section of the docs.

Features
--------

* parellize your tqdm runs using processes or threads thanks to concurrent.futures,
* just import ``pqdm`` from ``pqdm.threads`` or ``pqdm.processes`` to start,
* automatic usage of ``tqdm.notebook`` when iPython/Jupyter notebook environment detected,
* automatic parsing of ``pqdm`` kwargs and separating between ``concurrent.Executor`` args and ``tqdm`` args,
* support for any iterable and passing items as kwargs, args or directly to function which is being applied
* support bounded exectutors via https://github.com/mowshon/bounded_pool_executor
